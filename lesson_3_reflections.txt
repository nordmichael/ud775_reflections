#This is lesson 3, I think it is swell?

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
  Forks Exist on git-hub, basically a clone on their server
  Clone duplicates a repo locally or from remote to local source with original reference to the remote systems
  Branch splits out a section of code for editing, usually locally

  What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
    Can work offline to resolve any conflicts or merges, and then commit them online once you're done.
