#This is lesson 3, I think it is swell?

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
  Forks Exist on git-hub, basically a clone on their server
  Clone duplicates a repo locally or from remote to local source with original reference to the remote systems
  Branch splits out a section of code for editing, usually locally
