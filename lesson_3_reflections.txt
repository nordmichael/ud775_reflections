#This is lesson 3, I think it is swell?

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
  Forks Exist on git-hub, basically a clone on their server
  Clone duplicates a repo locally or from remote to local source with original reference to the remote systems
  Branch splits out a section of code for editing, usually locally

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
    Can work offline to resolve any conflicts or merges, and then commit them online once you're done.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
    Both are related, I think using GitHub will simplify collaboration by providing a distribution repo to
    work from without having to send files back and forth etc. 

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
    Other Branch can be used when you want to keep track of changes that might not make it into the master
    Or you're a part of a collaboration working on many changes, and you need to update and edit.
